# sales-data-analysis-python
This project explores retail sales data using Python, Pandas, and NumPy. It covers total sales, regional performance, product sales, high-value orders, and monthly trends, aimed at building beginner data analyst skills
Welcome to my beginner-friendly Sales Data Analysis project!
In this project, I analyzed sales records to derive insights about sales performance across categories, regions, products, and time.

This project is part of my journey as a fresher data analyst (2023 graduate) to apply Python skills in real-world data analysis.
