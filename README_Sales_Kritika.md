# 📈 Sales Data Analysis (Python, Pandas, NumPy)

Welcome to my beginner-friendly **Sales Data Analysis** project!  
In this project, I analyzed sales records to derive insights about sales performance across categories, regions, products, and time.

This project is part of my journey as a fresher data analyst (2023 graduate) to apply Python skills in real-world data analysis.
